LaraStack - Facade Design Pattern
Welcome to LaraStack, your ultimate destination for mastering software design patterns! In this topic, we will delve into the Facade Design Pattern, a powerful pattern that simplifies complex subsystem interactions and provides a unified interface.

What is the Facade Design Pattern?
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that acts as a "facade" to a complex subsystem, providing a simplified and unified interface for clients. It shields clients from the intricacies of the subsystem, making it easier to use and promoting loose coupling.
